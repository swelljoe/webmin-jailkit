<p>
Jailkit is a set of utilities to limit user accounts to specific files using chroot() and or specific commands. Setting up a chroot shell, a shell limited to some specific command, or a daemon inside a chroot jail is a lot easier and can be automated using these utilities.

  This module provides a user interface for managing the Jailkit jail configuration file (jk_init.ini). With it, you can create, modify, and delete jail definitions.
