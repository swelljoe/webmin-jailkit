<header>Paths to include (with setuid)</header>
  Comma-separated list of directory and file paths to include in the jail. These files will be setuid. Use extreme caution when placing setuid binaries into a chroot jail, as a poorly constructed program (or malicious one) could be used to escape the jail or escalate privileges.
